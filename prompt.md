## 2025-11-13 (Prompt 4)

Im going to gradually ask you to edit this text. Also, in the prompt.md file, the order is 1, 3, 2. fix this by going in order of 3, 2, 1 (top to bottom) and keep this order as we go. Rewrite the entire text, because right now I think you are relying too much on the conversation. Use your intuition as well for wording, formatting, ordering, explaining, and all.

Summary (2 sentences):
I will reorder the log to newest-first (now 4, 3, 2, 1) and keep that order going forward. I will also rewrite the standalone site’s text with clearer structure, fresh wording, and the same single expanding metaphor.

## 2025-11-13 (Prompt 3)

Ok lets delete and redo everything, keeping the same instructions as before. Except this time, I want this to be a completely seperate website from the About Samuel, or any other website, this is entirely new. Forget styling entirely, black times new roman on a white background for now.

Summary (2 sentences):
I will remove the previous integrated guide and link, then build a brand‑new standalone site in its own folder with a single page using black Times New Roman on white and no extra styling. I’ll keep the same content requirements (title “File Permissions,” full coverage, single expanding metaphor, no TOC/glossary) and continue logging prompts with summaries.

## 2025-11-13 (Prompt 2)

Make sure to log this prompt, the previous ones, and all of the ones to come in prompt.md. Instead of analogies, make one, ever expanding analogy/metaphor, where adding new terms and concepts is easily applicaple to the metaphor. Do not create the feel or integrate any of the style of my other websites, it needs to entirely and solely follow all of StyleGuide.tsx. In the intro also include a brief warning about the knowledge a user should have before reading this page, or else the page may not be very useful or understandable. Do not make a table of contents or gloassary for now. Technical terms do need to be included in that they should be learned by the user, but yes avoid heaby jargon, and whenever it is used, explain it. The title should just be File Permissions. The card in projects should be above/before the whackamole thats already there. No need for a one line description. Include all sections from the conversation. Use only the classes that exist in site.css. Forget reading level, this needs to be dummyproof, the audience is people who only understand what files and directories are. Page adress should be in the root file-permissions.html.

Summary (2 sentences):
I will create `file-permissions.html` in the root with a single expanding metaphor, thorough text-only explanations covering the conversation’s sections (without a TOC or glossary), and an intro warning about prerequisites, using only classes defined in `site.css`. I will also add a new Projects card above Whack‑A‑Mole linking to the guide, and continue logging every prompt with two-sentence summaries going forward.

## 2025-11-13 (Prompt 1)

After each prompt I ever give, append it in a prompt.md file.

Summarize results in 2 sentences after each prompt.

Make a website linked under the projects section of the About sam website, that teaches all of the stuff in the conversation attached file-permissions-conversation.md , strictly following the style guide in StyleGuide.tsx. Be as in depth as possible, and explain everything thouroughly, no term or concept left behind. It should for now all be text. Plan out/mimick the actions you would do if you were in agent mode but dont actually show me any code. Instead, Ask me any questions you have regarding what exactly you are to do, and report back to me any descisions you made on your own that I can specify in my prompt. Keep the technical terms to a minimum, Im not super well versed in the website lingo.

Summary (2 sentences):
I reviewed your project, the conversation content, and the style resources, and proposed a concrete plan and questions to finalize the page and Projects integration. I prepared to log prompts automatically and awaited your preferences on title, link placement, scope, and styling limits.
